# Specialist Publisher

Publishing App for Specialist Documents.

This application does not store documents in a database of its own. Instead it uses Publishing API to store and retrieve documents. MongoDB is used for storing local user records.

For each of the specialist finder schemas, `target_stack` property can be set to `draft` to only put the finder content onto the draft stack, and `live` to publish the finder to the `live` stack

## Some live examples

- [AAIB Reports](https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports)
- [CMA Cases](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases)
- [Countryside Stewardship Grants](https://www.gov.uk/countryside-stewardship-grants)
- [Drug Safety Update](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update)
- [International Development Funds](https://www.gov.uk/international-development-funding)
- [Medical Safety Alerts](https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts)
- [MAIB Reports](https://www.gov.uk/maib-reports)
- [RAIB Reports](https://www.gov.uk/raib-reports)

## Nomenclature

- **Format**: Category of a Document. Format names are listed in the `Live Examples` section above and include `MAIB Reports` and `CMA Cases`.
- **Finder**:  Sometimes Formats are referred to as Finders. They are called 'Finders' because each one of them creates a finder on GOV.UK, e.g. https://www.gov.uk/raib-reports. The formats are served by [Finder Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend).
- **Document**: Specialist Documents are created by Government editors and can be published to GOV.UK. Documents differ depending on their format, largely determined by the format's [schema](https://github.com/alphagov/specialist-publisher/blob/6f8eee9ef0bd3a4a72638f5e8301225e692145a3/lib/documents/schemas/aaib_reports.json).
- **Schema**: JSON files defining attributes for each format, including `base_path`, `document_noun` and `document_type`. It also contains the facets and their possible values for each `document_type` which are displayed by `_form.html.erb`.

You can use the [GOV.UK Docker environment](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) to run the application and its tests with all the necessary dependencies. Follow [the usage instructions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker#usage) to get started.

**Use GOV.UK Docker to run any commands that follow.**

### Running the test suite

```
$ bundle exec rake
```

### Running the app alongside finder-frontend

To test the document lifecycle end-to-end, from creating a document to viewing it in the finder, follow the steps in the [GOV.UK Docker README](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/govuk-docker/how-tos/finder-setup.html#content).
